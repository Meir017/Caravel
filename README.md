# Caravan

Using Canvas in the next generation.

Caravan is a custom Canvas client, making use of the Canvas APIs and services. Built on Angular, the goal is to load the app once and only once, cache applicable API requests, and deliver a faster and smoother experience than the current deployment provided by Instructure.

This project is similar to [SDBagel/Turbodrive](https://github.com/SDBagel/Turbodrive).
