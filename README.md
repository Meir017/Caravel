# Caravel

Caravel is a Canvas client that uses the Canvas Open API. It is designed as an SPA, rather than the MVC-style model that the official Canvas frontend uses. This means Caravel performs ***way faster*** with ***extremely good responsiveness***, especially on ***slow networks*** (found in many schools, public places, and other areas where students may find themselves). It also works offline!

Caravel is also a **PWA** (desktop & mobile) meaning you can take it wherever you go.

## Try It Out
You can try out Caravel with an API token from your account (Profile > Settings > New User Token).

- https://caravel.sdbagel.com `v0.5.8`
- https://caravel-next.sdbagel.com  `Synced with GitHub - v0.7.x+` (Recommended)

## Contributing

Please make an issue before you start coding to make sure your idea fits in with the goals of Caravel. After that, PRs are welcome.

## Instructure & Terms

Caravel does not have any official affiliation with Instructure, nor has there been any communication or cooperation. No part of Canvas LMS source code has been used in this application aside from info from public API documentation. Deploying Caravel at scale may present issues as you would need a developer key from your school's management to avoid having users paste in API tokens.
